# Overview

**rue** is a dependency injection container for nodejs that borrows concepts from
both [AngularJS](https://angularjs.com) and [Spring Framework](https://springframework.org).
At the core of **rue** is the goal to decouple configuration and application code.
One should be able to easily add **rue** to an existing project or conversly
remove it without having to greatly re-tool the main application code.

## Features
The core features of **rue** are as follows:

- Dependency injection with minimalistic configuration
- Configuration is decoupled and unintrusive from application code
- Module, service and factory patterns supported
- Singleton and non-singleton patterns supported
- Asynchronous activation and/or deactivation of dependencies with Promises support
- Separate activation profiles
- Leverages ES6 Proxies to enable swapping mocks and stubs for testing
